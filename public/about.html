<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hi my name is Rehyan. Don't worry it's a lot easier to pronounce than it looks. Ree-Anne. Pleasure to have you on my page.</p>
<p>I am a 31 year old aspiring web developer on a journey fueled by my excitement and commitment for continuous learning. With a diploma in media studies, a background in customer service, team leadership and working independently to ensure targets are always met, I'm now immersing myself in a 16-week front-end web development bootcamp to turn my passion into a profession.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I am also embarking in a full-stack developer journey where I will learn both front-end and back-end fundamentals.</p>

<p>I am captivated by the ever-evolving world of web development, where creativity meets technology. The ability to bring ideas to life through coding is what drives my enthusiasm. I am excited about the prospect of combining my diverse skill set with my newfound coding skills to create innovative and impactful web solutions. </p>

<p>Throughout the bootcamp I am acquiring hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is not just to learn the technical skills but to apply them creatively to design user-friendly and visually appealing websites for everyones needs. </p>

<p>In addition to my formal education, I am an avid self-learner, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge. I am committed to staying at the forefront of web development trends and continuously refining my skills. </p>

<p>I am eager to connect with fellow developers, mentors, and potential collaborators. Whether you have advice to share, a project to collaborate on, or just want to chat about web development, feel free to reach out!</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the exciting journey ahead in the world of front-end web development!</p>
